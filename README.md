##About EJS
EJS is a simple templating language that is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It allows developers to include dynamic content in their web pages by inserting JavaScript code directly into the HTML. This makes it easy to create and maintain the structure of a web page while still being able to include dynamic content.

##Getting Started

Once all of the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:
